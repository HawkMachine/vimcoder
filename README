VimCoder
--------

The TopCoder Arena editor plug-in providing support for Vim.

The version is very experimental, and I haven't gotten around to writing
any substantial documentation.  It is also not very configurable without
changing the code.  All of these problems will be remedied eventually.


Features:

- Use Vim to edit your TopCoder Arena problems!
- Keeps track of code files locally and syncs with the server, so no more
  copy and pasting to and from the Arena applet.
- Works with any language.
- Downloads and stores a copy of the problem statement with your code for
  off-line viewing.
- Basic support for templates (currently C++ only).
- Local test-case drivers can be automatically created with the example
  test-case data (currently C++ only, and has bugs).


Compatibility:

I've tested the plug-in only on my own computer which runs x86_64 Linux.
It should work on other setups, but note the following:

- The program "gvim" should be in your PATH.
- Vim needs to be compiled with client/server support.  To check, make sure
  the command "vim --version | grep +clientserver" prints something.
- The test-case driver generated for C++ uses POSIX functions for timing,
  so it may not compile on non-POSIX systems (i.e. Windows).  The C++Driver
  template simply needs to be changed to support other timing functions.


How To Install:

Assuming you have the downloaded the VimCoder jar file:

- Run the TopCoder Arena applet.
- Click the "Options" menu and select "Editor" to show the editor
  preferences.
- Click the "Add" button to bring up a new window.
- For "Name," type "Vim" or whatever you want to represent this plug-in.
- For "EntryPoint," type "com.dogcows.VimCoder" without the quotes.
- For "ClassPath," click on "Browse" and locate the VimCoder jar file.  The
  third field should now have the path to the jar file.
- Click "OK" to close the window with the three fields.
- Click "Save."

You should now be able select "Vim" (or whatever you entered the first
field) to use the plug-in.  If it doesn't work (i.e. nothing happens), you
may need to restart the applet or set the plug-in as the default editor.
Your mileage may vary.


Known Bugs:

- Lack of documentation.  The code itself is also poorly documented.
- Only C++ templates are provided.
- The generated C++ driver code won't compile when the method has one or
  more parameters that are vectors (i.e. vectors of strings).
- The $CARAT$ token doesn't seem to work in the templates.
- Directory where code and problem data is saved is hardcoded at
  ~/.vimcoder.  This should be configurable.
